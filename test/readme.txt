  C-TEST

  A small C test framework. Simply place these files into your test folder,
  make some tweaks to the Makefile, write your tests, and you're done! Your
  workflow would be:

    1) Write tests.
    2) Run tests.

    make mytest         # Run a single test
    make myunit/mytest  # You can have subfolders!
    make                # Run all tests (all .c files in this folder)

  I use this test framework for my C projects because I can't find an
  easy-to-install test framework for C.
